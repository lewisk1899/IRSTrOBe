## What is the IRSTrOBe?
The STrOBe is a small, portable beacon that can be used to identify a target in the field. The device emits in the 1550 wavelength range such that it is only viewable to personnel equipped with specialized SWIR night vision devices. This device should be small and portable enough to be deployed by hand or by drone, rugged enough to be thrown or dropped onto the target, remotely programmable for field flexibility, and bright enough to be seen from a distance. The successful team will find clever solutions to the many open ended problems that this project presents with the oversight and mentorship of two dedicated University of Arizona alumni who are senior level engineers at Elbit Systems of America that are dedicated to your success! Deliverables include all design drawings and documentation as well as working prototypes.
